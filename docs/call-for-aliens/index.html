<h1>Inter&shy;galactic Receiver</h1>
<p>
  Maybe this is the first device to receive <b>alien transmissions</b>.
  A curious object that looks like a vintage radio, or a computer
  from <i>Severance</i>. It has a weird antenna at the top,
  and it is connected to a flickering, low-resolution CRT television.

  Mostly the screen shows static. But as you fiddle with the tuning knob, you soon discover that there are
  stations at certain frequencies. The transmissions are abstract procedural animations. They look like something
  created by alien minds: mathematical, geometric, but somehow also warm and compassionate.
  They are multi-dimensional streams of friendship and curiosity from outer space.

  * This image shows the calibration of the Receiver's controls. The finished Receiver will be connected to a full-sized
  color TV, which will show either static or animations generated from code in real time.
</p>
<p>
  Or is this <b>art</b>? Maybe the animations were coded up by creative sorcerers who practice the dark art of
  shader graphics, or Hydra video synthesis. That would make the Inter&shy;galactic Receiver a collaborative
  art project, a platform for the work of several algorithmic artists.

<h2>Call for Alien Artists</h2>

<p>
  <em>Received by:</em> Transceiver Relay01 at Relay<br>
  <em>Language path:</em> Acquileron  Triskweline, SjK: Relay units<br>
  <em>From:</em> Net Administrator for Transceiver Windsong at Debley Down<br>
  <em>Subject:</em> Emerging civilization first contact<br>
  <em>Key phrases:</em> first contact, medium zone of thought, visual intelligence<br>
  <em>Distribution:</em> Generative Friendship Special Interest Group, Circle of Galactic Compassion<br>
  <em>Date:</em> 07:21:21 Docks Time, 36/09 of Org year 52089<br><br>
  <em>Text of message:</em><br>

  Refracted propagation picked up by sublight sensors reveals that a new quantum entanglement device
  has been activated in the 3JNE-CCB system. The system's indigenous civilization has not previously been
  capable of intergalactic communication. Only a single device is in operation, and it is only capable of
  receiving quantum entanglements. At a pre-solarpunk stage of development it is to be expected that the operators
  do not yet possess the kind of laminar energy flows needed to spawn outgoing entaglement.<br><br>

  On past occasions the mistake has been made to broadcast a purely rationalistic message devoid of creativity,
  playfulness, art or compassion. We are therefore announcing this <b>Open Call</b> for all members of
  Generative Friendship and Galactic Compassion.<br><br>

  Please respond with existing or suggested shader art within the receiver's rudimentary computational bounds:
</p>
<ul class="inner">
  <li>720x576 pixel canvas at 50FPS; possibly an 80-pixel inivisible overscan on both sides</li>
  <li>Executed by the VideoCore IV GPU of a Raspberry Pi 4B, and rendered over Composite Video on a cathode ray tube
    TV</li>
  <li>OpenGL ES 3.1 is supported, i.e., GLSL ES 3.10, i.e., #version 310 es. This uses in/out instead of attribute
    and varying.</li>
  <li>The shader will run in a headless environment (no window server). The renderer is a small, efficient,
    dependency-free app written in C++ on top of the DRM/GBM/EGL stack, drawing directly to the screen.</li>
  <li>The sketch can be a fragment shader, or a vertex+fragment shader, and it can include frame-by-frame calculations
    on the CPU. The simpler the better, and it would be best if you can make do without interim framebuffers (but
    we can talk). In any case I'll be happy to do the bulk of porting your sketch to C++ if needed.</li>
  <li>The sketch can also be Hydra! There are some limitations, but we can extract the shader code from most
    Hydra sketches and have them executed on the device's GPU directly.</li>
  <li>The sketch can be interactive! The receiver discovered in the 3JNE-CCB system includes three linear inputs,
    which the native beings control by turning knobs on the device. One of these knobs is very noisy and imprecise,
    so that channel will be smoothly quantized to 4 or 8 values.</li>
  <li>We will map our transmissions to a scale familiar in the system. It's called the FM band and goes from 88 to 108
    MHz in local units.</li>
  <li>We will side-load every station with author information. When the tuner is slightly off your station's
    frequency, we will overlay text in the system's native alphabet. You can present your name or alias, and any other
    authorship information you wish, in this side-loaded information overlay.</li>
  <li>All software and hardware details of the system built on 3JNE-CCB are available here:
    <a href="https://github.com/gugray/InterGalacticReceiver">github.com/gugray/InterGalacticReceiver</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you are interested in contributing a shader animation for a station, get in touch with <b>Gábor</b>.
  Your artwork will spark joy in the people of 3JNE-CCB.
